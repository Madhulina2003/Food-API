The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension that is  either a row or a column but not both at the same time.
where as Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout that is rows and columns at the same time.

flex box cannot easily overlap items or elements where as grid can create overlapping layouts very easily


basic difference between id and class.
In Html for an element ID name starts with the “#” symbol followed by a unique name assigned to it.
whereas O class assigned to an element has its name starts with “.” followed by class name.

Only one ID selector can be attached to an element. 
where as Multiple class selectors can be attached to an element.
